        <h2>Personal Details</h2>
        <p>Hi there üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
        <p>
          I'm Jessica Urowoli Imoesemi. I'm a Nigerian, from Delta State, and
          I'm also a frontend engineering student at the prestigious AltSchool
          Africa.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a graduate of the University of Benin, with a degree in
          Biochemistry. What has life science got to do with computer science
          right?ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Well, my passion for tech and 'computer' led me here.
        </p>
        <p>Aside tech, I also love music and medieval movies.</p>

        <h2>Reason for joining AltSchool Africa</h2>

        <p>
          Prior to signing up at AltSchool, I was learning on my own, watching
          videos on YouTube and Udemy. But I wasn't getting the support and push
          in the right direction that I wanted. Then, AltSchool came along.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was just perfect, everything I wanted. AltSchool gives me a defined
          and well structured path to follow in my frontend journey. The school
          also has a vibrant community of like minds where we encourage and push
          ourselves beyond limit!
        </p>
        <p>
          I also joined AltSchool because I saw that their students have a high
          chance of getting internships. The goal afterall is to make a career
          out of tech, not just the knowledge.
        </p>

        <h2>What I plan to achieve with AltSchool Africa</h2>
        <p>
          Like I mentioned earlier, The goal is to make a career out of tech,
          and that's exactly what I plan to achieve at the end of this program.
          Getting the right technical skills, softskills and exposure that will
          start me up on the right footing in the industry.
